# RiffMuse

RiffMuse is an inspirational tool to help composers in their creative process. By leveraging different deep learning symbolic music generative models, RiffMuse is able to produce short musical riffs that can be used as a foundation for compositional ideation.

Under samples/, a few generated samples from the various models are available for perusal.

Under application/, some key files include app.py, which renders the front-end, and processing.py, which is used for adapting the generated output based on the parameters inputted by the user.

Under applications/model, some notable files include baseline_generation.py, which details the baseline RNN model’s generation process, and HRNN/hrnn_generation, which includes the HRNN model’s generation code.

Also under applications/model is CNNGAN/cnn_gan_model which defines the architecture of the generator, discriminator, and sample generator.

All the requirements necessary are detailed in requirements.txt
